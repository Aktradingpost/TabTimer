## Tips & Tricks

### Auto-Delete by Date

Name your schedule with a date prefix to auto-delete:
- `2026-01-31 Amazon Gift Card Giveaway`
- `2026-02-14 Valentine's Contest`

After that date passes, the schedule is automatically removed!

### Grace Period for Missed Schedules

If your computer was off when a schedule was supposed to open:
- TabTimer will open it within **2 minutes** of turning on
- Never miss a scheduled opening!

### Best Practices for Sweepstakes

1. **Use auto-stagger**: When importing multiple URLs, stagger by 30-60 seconds to avoid overwhelming your browser
2. **Set auto re-lock**: Use 5-10 minutes so recurring schedules reset properly
3. **Use date prefixes**: Name schedules with end dates for automatic cleanup
4. **Organize by category**: Use Daily, Weekly, Monthly to stay organized

### Organizing Large Numbers of Schedules

1. **Search**: Use the search box to find specific schedules
2. **Categories**: Assign categories for filtering
3. **Colors** (Premium): Color-code by priority or type
4. **Date names**: Include dates in names for sorting

## Troubleshooting

### Schedule didn't open

1. **Was Chrome running?** TabTimer needs Chrome open to work
2. **Check the time**: Make sure the scheduled time has passed
3. **Grace period**: If Chrome was closed, wait up to 2 minutes after opening

### "Manifest file is missing" error

1. Make sure you extracted the ZIP file completely
2. The folder should contain `manifest.json` directly (not in a subfolder)
3. Try re-extracting the ZIP

### Schedule opened but page didn't load

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the URL is correct
3. Some sites may block automated opens

### Premium features locked after trial

This is expected! Your trial has ended. Options:
- Continue using free features (your schedules are safe!)
- Purchase Premium for $10 lifetime access

### How to reset trial (for testing only)

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Find TabTimer and click "Remove"
3. Reinstall the extension
4. Note: This also removes all your schedules!
